                    <p><i>Though I was born Enerrioya, everyone prefers to call me Nerry.<br> I dont blame them
                        cause my full name is indeed hard to pronounce and besides "Nerry" <br>seem like a fancy name. I am currently 
                        learning to become a freelance web developer at the <br>Edoworx Udacity scholarship programme.
                        So far the programme has been really interesting and I <br>honestly can't wait to graduate and start taking on freelance
                        jobs.
