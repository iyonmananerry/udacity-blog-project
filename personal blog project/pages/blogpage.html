                <p><blockquote cite="https://bestlifeonline.com/love-signs-men/"></blockquote> It's difficult—if not impossible—to gauge 
                    how someone else is feeling in a 
                    relationship. But if you're considering whether you're falling in love with 
                    your partner, you're probably wondering if they are, too. Fortunately, .science has actually 
                    pin-pointed some tangible signs a man is falling in love. Watch your partner for these subtle clues he's head over heels.</p>

                <h2>How to build Godly relationships</h2>
                <p><blockquote cite="https://studentship.com.ng/how-to-build-a-godly-relationship-before-marriage/"></blockquote> to build a godly dating relationship before marriage is a popular topic 
                    of discussion for Christian teenagers, college students and young adults.
                    In the dating world, there are a lot of differences between secular dating and 
                    Christian dating. The latter requires adherence to godly dating principles.</p>

                <p>It's not always easy to parse out what the person sitting across from you wants in a relationship. 
                    Sure, you could always ask the woman you're dating what she wants (and in fact, you should), but let's be honest: That's easier said than done. To give those curious a look at what women actually want from men, here's a good place to start.
                     Just remember: Every individual is different, so this list should be the foundation on which you can build. </p>

                        <p>Though I was born Enerrioya, everyone prefers to call me Nerry.<br> I dont blame them
                            cause my full name is indeed hard to pronounce and besides "Nerry" <br>seem like a fancy name. I am currently 
                            learning to become a freelance web developer at the <br>Edoworx Udacity scholarship programme.
                            So far the programme has been really interesting and I <br>honestly can't wait to graduate and start taking on freelance
                            jobs.</p>
